Recursion : Function call itself
we need to find the recursive function to solve the proble using recursion 
which problems can be solved by recursion?
The problem which we an divide into sub problems and the can create a pattern or recursive function out of it 
For example : fibonacci number

1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....

you can write f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

and then we have a base condition to break the loop for keep going : 

public int fibo(int n)
{
if(n < 2)
{
return n ;
}
else{
return fibo(n-2) + fibo(n-1);
}

}

public static void main(String args[])
{
fibo(5);
}
